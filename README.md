Rock, Paper, Scissors APCSP Project

Hello! This project is for my AP Computer Science Principles end-of-year project, where I recreated Rock, Paper, Scissors in Processing using Python.
I wanted to test my proficiency in Python, as well as learn how to use Processing for future applications. Thus, I decided to recreate this game.
This project taught me several key features of Processing: mouse and keyboard inputs, drawing images and shapes, and a basic idea of how games are programmed.
The images I used were images that I drew myself, since they allowed me to maintain a consistent and uniform art style that I desired.
